.. topic:: Overview

    g-Octave is a tool that generates and installs ebuilds for
    `Octave-Forge`_ packages "on-the-fly" to `Gentoo Linux`_, using
    Portage_. It's capable to generate ebuilds and Manifest files for
    the packages, and to install them using an autogenerated overlay
    (named g-octave). g-Octave can also handle patches to the packages
    automatically. The command line interface tries to be very similar
    to the interface of the ``emerge`` tool.
