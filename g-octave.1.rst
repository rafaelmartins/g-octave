SYNOPSIS
========

g-octave [options] <package_name | package_name-version>


DESCRIPTION
===========

g-octave is a tool that generates and installs ebuilds for Octave-Forge
packages "on-the-fly" to Gentoo Linux, using Portage. It's capable to
generate ebuilds and Manifest files for the packages, and to install
them using an autogenerated overlay (named g-octave). g-octave can also
handle patches to the packages automatically. The command line interface
tries to be very similar to the interface of the emerge(1) tool.

At this moment g-octave depends on the Portage package manager to works,
but the support to Paludis and pkgcore is planned.
